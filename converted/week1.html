    <p>1. What are the differences between Core Java and Advanced Java?</p>
    <p>Core Java:</p>
    <p> Core Java contains basic concepts of java like syntax, libraries and used for developing general purpose applications. Core Java forms the foundation of the Java programming language.</p>
    <p>Key Features:</p>
    <p>1.Basic Language Constructs</p>
    <p>2.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</p>
    <p>3.Standard Libraries</p>
    <p>4.Exception Handling</p>
    <p>5.Multithreading and Concurrency</p>
    <p>6.Basic I/O operations</p>
    <p>Advanced Java:</p>
    <p>Advanced Java builds upon the fundamentals of Core Java and introduces more advanced concepts and technologies that are essential for developing enterprise-level, web-based, and distributed applications.</p>
    <p>Key Features:</p>
    <p>1.Database Connectivity</p>
    <p>2.Web Technologies</p>
    <p>3.Enterprise Java</p>
    <p>4.Web Services</p>
    <p>5.Advanced Networking</p>
    <p>6.Security</p>
    <p>2. What are the main important features of Applets in Java?</p>
    <p>Java Applets:</p>
    <p>A Java Applet is a Java program that runs inside a web browser. An Applet is embedded in an HTML file using &lt;applet&gt; or &lt;objects&gt; tags. Applets are used to make the website more dynamic and entertaining. Applets are executed in a sandbox for security, restricting access to local system resources.</p>
    <p>Key Features:</p>
    <p>1.Interactive and Dynamic Content</p>
    <p>2.Graphical Capabilities</p>
    <p>3.Platform Independence</p>
    <p>4.Event Handling</p>
    <p>5.Limited System Access</p>
    <p>6.Embedding in HTML</p>
    <p>7.Parameterization</p>
    <p>8.Interaction with Browsers</p>
    <p>9.Potential Security Risks</p>
    <p>3. What are the key features of Java Servlets?</p>
    <p>Java Servlets:</p>
    <p>Java Servlet is a Java program that runs on a Java-enabled web server or application server. It handles client requests, processes them, and generates responses dynamically. Servlets are the backbone of many server-side Java applications due to their efficiency and scalability.</p>
    <p>Key Features:</p>
    <p>1.Platform Independence</p>
    <p>2.Server-Side Processing </p>
    <p>3.HTTP Protocol Support</p>
    <p>4.Performance. </p>
    <p>5.Robustness and Security</p>
    <p>6.Session Management</p>
    <p>7.Integration with Java Ecosystem</p>
    <p>8.Extensibility</p>
    <p>9.Dynamic Content Generation</p>
    <p>4. What are the differences between Applets and Servlets in Java?</p>
    <p>Applets:</p>
    <p>1.Client-side:</p>
    <p>Applets execute within a web browser on the user&#x27;s computer. </p>
    <p>2.GUI Focus:</p>
    <p>They are commonly used to provide interactive elements, animations, or games within a webpage. </p>
    <p>3.Security Restrictions:</p>
    <p>Applets operate under security restrictions imposed by the browser to protect the user&#x27;s system. </p>
    <p>4.Lifecycle:</p>
    <p>Applets have a lifecycle defined by methods like init(), start(), stop(), paint(), and destroy(). </p>
    <p>Servlets:</p>
    <p>1.Server-side:</p>
    <p>Servlets run on the server and handle requests from clients (typically browsers). </p>
    <p>2.Dynamic Content:</p>
    <p>They are used to generate dynamic web content, process user input, and interact with databases. </p>
    <p>3.Lifecycle:</p>
    <p>Servlets have a lifecycle managed by the servlet container (e.g., Tomcat), including methods like init(), service(), and destroy(). </p>
    <p>4.No GUI:</p>
    <p>Servlets typically do not have a graphical user interface (GUI). </p>
    <p>5.Communication:</p>
    <p>They communicate with the client (browser) through HTTP requests and responses. </p>
    <p>5. What are the major features of Java compared to other programming languages?</p>
    <p>Major Features:</p>
    <p>Platform Independence</p>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</p>
    <p>Automatic Memory Management</p>
    <p>Multithreading</p>
    <p>High Performance</p>
    <p>Rich API</p>
    <p>Simplicity</p>
    <p>Distributed Computing</p>
    <p>Robustness</p>
    <p>6. What is the main role of JDBC and ODBC in database connectivity?</p>
    <p>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) both provide APIs for database connectivity, but JDBC is specifically designed for Java applications, while ODBC is a more general standard that can be used by various programming languages. JDBC acts as a bridge between Java applications and databases, enabling them to interact with different database management systems using a consistent interface. ODBC, on the other hand, provides a standardized way for applications to connect to various database systems through a common interface, regardless of the specific database or operating system. </p>
    <p>7. What are the differences between ODBC and JDBC?</p>
    <p>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) are both APIs that allow applications to connect to databases, but they differ in their primary use and language support. JDBC is specifically designed for Java applications, while ODBC is a more general API that can be used with various programming languages like C, C++, and others. </p>
    <p>8. What are the differences between Cookies and Sessions in web applications?</p>
    <p>In web applications, sessions and cookies are used to manage user information, but they differ significantly in how they store and manage data. Sessions are primarily stored on the server, providing more security and capacity for data, while cookies are stored on the user&#x27;s browser, making them more susceptible to security risks. Sessions end when the user closes the browser or logs out, whereas cookies can persist based on their defined lifespan. </p>
    <p>9. What are the differences between Spring Boot and the traditional Spring Framework?</p>
    <p>Spring Boot builds upon the Spring Framework by simplifying its configuration and deployment. Spring Boot uses auto-configuration and &quot;starters&quot; to handle much of the setup automatically, allowing for faster development and deployment compared to the traditional Spring Framework, which requires more manual configuration. </p>
    <p>10. What are the differences between standalone applications and web applications?</p>
    <p>Standalone applications and web applications differ primarily in how they are accessed and run. Standalone applications are installed and run directly on a user&#x27;s device, while web applications are accessed through a web browser and run on a server. This distinction leads to differences in installation, accessibility, performance, and security. </p>
    <p>11. What are the basic requirements for executing a web application?</p>
    <p>To execute   a web application, you primarily need a web server, a domain name, a server-side programming language, and a database. Additionally, a solid understanding of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is essential for creating the user interface. </p>
